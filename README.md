## About Me

I’m a software engineer and data scientist with experience spanning startups, large tech companies, and diverse domains including legal tech, web development, and data infrastructure.

I’ve worked across the stack, from backend and frontend to full-stack and data science, building scalable web and mobile applications, optimizing performance, and designing systems that support real-world business intelligence.

I bring a balance of technical expertise and collaboration, with strengths in:
- Mentorship & knowledge sharing
- Autonomous remote work  
- Cross-team collaboration  
- Attention to detail and long-term maintainability  

What motivates me is using technology to solve meaningful problems, especially in industries like **healthcare** and **education**, where impact matters most.
