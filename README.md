# Hi, Iâ€™m Katherine 
*a software engineer and data scientist passionate about impactful solutions.*

## About Me

Iâ€™m a software engineer and data scientist with experience spanning startups, large tech companies, and diverse domains including legal tech, web development, and data infrastructure.

Iâ€™ve worked across the stack â€” from backend and frontend to full-stack and data science â€” building scalable web and mobile applications, optimizing performance, and designing systems to support real-world business intelligence.

I bring a balance of technical expertise and collaboration, with strengths in:
- Mentorship & leadership  
- Autonomous remote work  
- Cross-team collaboration  
- Attention to detail and long-term maintainability  

What motivates me is using technology to solve meaningful problems, especially in industries like **healthcare** and **education**, where impact matters most.
